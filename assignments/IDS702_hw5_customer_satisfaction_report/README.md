## üìÇ **Homework Overview**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Homework 1: Sampling Distributions**  
**Focus**: Simulation and sampling techniques using R.  
- Conducted simulations to evaluate sample size and sampling schemes.  
- Explored the sampling distribution of the mean under various sampling methods:  
  - Simple Random Sampling (SRS)  
  - Cluster Sampling  
  - Stratified Sampling  
- **Key Learning**: Understanding how sample size and method impact distribution properties.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Homework 2: Likelihood and Hypothesis Testing**  
**Focus**: Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and hypothesis testing.  
- Derived the likelihood and log-likelihood functions.  
- Investigated relationships between smoking and birth weight using hypothesis tests.  
- Conducted Chi-square tests for independence and visualized relationships.  
- **Key Learning**: Application of hypothesis testing techniques and MLE in real-world data.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Homework 3: Graduation Rate Modeling**  
**Focus**: Regression modeling and model diagnostics.  
- Analyzed factors influencing graduation rates using linear regression.  
- Explored model diagnostics (residuals, QQ-plots) and transformations (log transformations).  
- Assessed the impact of interaction terms in regression models.  
- **Key Learning**: Building, refining, and interpreting regression models.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Homework 4: NBA Wins Analysis**  
**Focus**: Logistic Regression for Predicting Wins.  
- Analyzed Charlotte Hornets' performance to identify factors associated with wins.  
- Fitted logistic regression models and interpreted odds ratios.  
- Evaluated model accuracy using confusion matrices, ROC curves, and AUC.  
- Conducted deviance tests to assess model improvements.  
- **Key Learning**: Logistic regression, model interpretation, and evaluation.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Homework 5: Customer Satisfaction Report**  
**Focus**: Professional Reporting and GLM Modeling.  
- Analyzed airline customer satisfaction data using generalized linear models (GLM).  
- Produced two reports:  
  1. A **technical report** for data scientists.  
  2. An **executive summary** for non-technical stakeholders.  
- Compared models and evaluated assumptions using confusion matrices and diagnostics.  
- **Key Learning**: Balancing technical depth and business communication in reporting.
