### Project Overview

This project analyzes UFC data to uncover insights into how physical attributes and tactical strategies impact fight outcomes. Using data spanning over a decade (2010-2024), the team examined relationships such as the impact of fighter reach on strikes landed and the role of submission attempts in predicting fight results. Dive in to explore data-driven insights into the world of mixed martial arts (MMA).


### Key Research Questions:
1. How does fighter reach affect the total number of strikes landed during a fight?
2. Is the fight outcome associated with the number of submission attempts?

## Data

- **Source**: Kaggle
- **Description**: Data includes fighter attributes (height, weight, reach, etc.), fight statistics, betting odds, and outcomes.
- **Size**: 6,478 rows across 118 variables; preprocessed to 4,895 rows for analysis.

## Methodology

1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Columns with >6,000 missing values were removed.
   - Remaining data cleaned for consistency and relevance.
2. **Exploratory Analysis**:
   - Summary statistics for reach, strikes, and submission attempts.
   - Categorization by weight classes.
3. **Modeling**:
   - **Linear Regression**: Examined the relationship between reach and strikes landed.
   - **Logistic Regression**: Evaluated submission attempts' impact on fight outcomes.

## Results

### Research Question 1: Fighter Reach and Strikes Landed
- Significant but complex relationship between reach and strikes.
- Adjusted \( R^2 \): 0.068 (indicating modest explanatory power).
- Weight classes influenced the relationship:
  - Featherweight fighters landed more strikes.
  - Flyweight fighters landed fewer strikes.

### Research Question 2: Submission Attempts and Fight Outcomes
- Logistic regression revealed:
  - **Red Corner Submission Attempts**: Increased win probability (\( OR = 1.549, p < 0.001 \)).
  - **Blue Corner Submission Attempts**: Decreased win probability (\( OR = 0.709, p < 0.001 \)).
  - Significant role of reach and striking efficiency in determining outcomes.
